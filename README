================================

=head1 NAME

Test::RandomResults - Test non-deterministic functions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module aims to provide ways of testing functions that are meant
to return results that are random; that is, non-deterministic
functions.

Some of the tests provided here might be easily achieved with other
testing modules. The reason why they're here is that this way users
become aware of how to test their non-deterministic functions.

=head1 NOTICE

This is a work in progress. Comments are welcome.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::More plan => $Num_Tests;
  use Test::RandomResults;

  is_in( my_function, [ $list, $of, $items ], "result is inside list" );

  length_lt( my_function, $limit, "length lower than $limit");

  length_le( my_function, $limit, "length lower or equal to $limit");

  length_eq( my_function, $limit, "length equal to $limit");

  length_ge( my_function, $limit, "length greater of equal to $limit");

  length_gt( my_function, $limit, "length greater than $limit");

=head1 SPECIAL FEATURES

Whenever I<Test::RandomResults> is invoked, a new seed is generated
and outputed as diagnostics. This is done so that you can use it to
debug your code, if needed.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 is_in

Tests if an element belongs to an array.

  is_in( my_function, [1, 2, 3], 'either 1, 2 or 3');

=head2 in_between

Tests if an element is within two boundaries.

The second parameter to this function is what it uses to do the
comparisons.

To compare strings:

  in_between( my_function, { $_[0] cmp $_[1] }, "aaa", "zzz",
              'result is between "aaa" and "zzz"' );

To compare numbers:

  in_between( my_function, { $_[0] <=> $_[1] }, 1, 10, "result is between 1 and 10" );

I<in_between> swaps the lower and upper limits, if need be (this means
that checking whether a value is between 1 and 10 is the same as
checking between 10 and 1).

=head2 length_lt

Tests if length is lower than a limit.

  length_lt( my_function, $limit, "length lower than $limit");

=head2 length_le

Tests if length is lower or equal to a limit.

  length_le( my_function, $limit, "length lower or equal to $limit");

=head2 length_eq

Tests if length is equal to a limit.

  length_eq( my_function, $limit, "length equal to $limit");

=head2 length_ge

Tests if length is greater of equal to a limit.

  length_ge( my_function, $limit, "length greater of equal to $limit");

=head2 length_gt

Tests if length is greater than a limit.

  length_gt( my_function, $limit, "length greater than $limit");

=head1 TO DO

* Check if N results of a function are evenly_distributed
